## Project Overview

This project integrates advanced CPU scheduling algorithms with modern AI techniques to optimize process management. It combines traditional scheduling methods with Genetic Algorithms (GA) for both single-objective and multi-objective optimization, and a basic Q-learning approach for reinforcement learning.

---

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Scheduling:** Implements classical algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, Priority, SJF, Preemptive Priority) for CPU scheduling.
- **AI Optimization:** Utilizes Genetic Algorithms and Q-learning to optimize scheduling performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Generates Gantt charts and other visual outputs using Matplotlib.
- **Modern DevOps Practices:** Includes Docker containerization and GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
- **Result Logging:** Outputs simulation results to CSV files for further analysis.
