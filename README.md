## ü§ñ Technical Approach  

### üîπ **Classical Scheduling Algorithms**  
This project implements various **traditional CPU scheduling techniques**, including:  

- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):** Executes processes in the order they arrive.  
- **Round Robin (RR):** Time-sliced execution for fair process scheduling.  
- **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling:** Processes execute based on priority.  
- **Preemptive Priority Scheduling:** Higher-priority processes can interrupt lower-priority processes.  
- **Shortest Job First (SJF):** Selects the shortest burst time for better efficiency.

### üîπ **AI-Based Optimization**  

#### üß¨ **Genetic Algorithm (GA) Optimization**  
- Uses **evolutionary techniques** to find the **optimal process execution order**.  
- Implements both **single-objective** (waiting time minimization) and **multi-objective** (balancing waiting & turnaround time).  

#### üèÜ **Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) Optimization**  
- AI dynamically learns the best scheduling sequence.  
- The **Q-learning model** is trained to **reduce waiting time** through reward-based decision-making.

### üîπ **Performance Metrics & Analysis**  
- **Average Waiting Time:** Measures idle duration before process execution.  
- **Turnaround Time:** Measures total time from arrival to completion.  
- **CPU Utilization:** Evaluates efficiency of CPU usage.  
- **Throughput:** Calculates the number of completed processes per unit time.  
- **Gantt Charts:** Graphical representation of scheduling execution sequences.
